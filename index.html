       <p class="About_Us-Info">Our two&#45;part rescue mission at Arctic Fox Daily&#58;<br>

1. Provide forever sanctuary to captive&#45;bred unwanted, neglected, abandoned, non&#45;releasable wildlife, specializing in foxes and wolfdogs.<br>

2. Practice wildlife rehabilitation&#58; We rescue, raise, and release orphaned, New York&#45;native wildlife. The end goal of wildlife rehabilitation is always to allow the animal to take its place back in nature.<br><br>

<q>Hi everyone, my name&#39;s Kimberly. My family and I live in Upstate New York, which is where I run my home&#45;based wildlife rescue. I&#39;ve been volunteering my time working with and raising rescued wildlife and exotic pets since 2012. I possess both federal USDA and NYS DEC licenses, which allow me to legally work with these animals. In 2020, my rescue efforts had grown enough that I decided to take the leap to found a nonprofit, and that&#39;s when Arctic Fox Daily Wildlife Rescue Inc. was born.</q><br><br>

All of our non&#45;releasable permanent residents were either born in captivity &#45; not taken from the wild &#45; or have a permanent disability that would prevent them from surviving and thriving in the wild. We love sharing a look into the behaviors and lives of these beautiful animals, enjoy helping people learn about the realities of exotic pet ownership &#40;foxes really don&#39;t make good pets&#41;, and enjoy furthering conservation efforts through education.<br><br>


Rescuing these animals is time&#45;consuming, many times heartbreaking, but most of all &#45; it&#39;s incredibly rewarding&#33; The feeling associated with A&#41; being able to provide forever sanctuary to an animal who&#39;d otherwise have been euthanized and B&#41; opening up an enclosure door and allowing a rehabilitated animal to take its place back in nature is so unique and special.<br><br>

 

As of September 2020, we are officially a 501&#40;c&#41;&#40;3&#41; non&#45;profit organization&#33; We are so excited about having taken this big step, and know that it will ultimately help us help more animals&#33;  This means that members of the public and businesses can now make tax&#45;deductible donations to our rescue. Learn more about different ways to do so on the Contribute page of our website.</p>
