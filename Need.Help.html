This is an <br>online database featuring rehabbers throughout the United States.<b>In the meantime,</b> if safely possible, keep the animal contained in <br>a quiet, safe dark area with as little stimulation and human/pet traffic as possible and do not handle it. I do not recommend attempting <br>to feed wildlife you find until they get to a rehabber, as it may do more harm than good if the animal is not yet stabilized and hydrated.</p>

              Need placement for a captive&#45;born fox, wolfdog, or other exotic pet or rescue&#63; Since these animals are born in captivity, <br>this means that they must stay in captivity, as it is both illegal and immoral to release a captive&#45;bred wild animal. Please feel free<br> to send me a detailed email if you need assistance. Include the species, age, vet history &#40;if any&#41;, temperament, any important details <br>or quirks, and photos of the animal. Please note that depending on the species of animal and my capacity limitations, I cannot<br> guarantee that I can intake your animal. <br><br><b>Note for Wolfdog/Wolf Hybrid Placement&#58;</b> Like fox sanctuaries, many Wolfdog sanctuaries are always running at full capacity. <br>For this reason, as clich&eacute; as it may sound, I STRONGLY suggest making a post on the Wolfdog rehoming groups you can find on <br>Facebook. You'll have to request to join these groups &#40;there are a couple&#41; prior to posting. IF there is a facility or qualified home that <br>is looking for a specific temperament, gender, content &#37;, etc., I guarantee they will be keeping their eyes on these Facebook group <br>postings. You will have to use your own discretion when it comes to vetting potential homes. <br><br>
