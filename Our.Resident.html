In 2012, I purchased Toto &#45; the only fox I've <q>purchased</q> &#45; out of a sketchy situation when he was approximately 4 months old. I was 18 years&#45;old, a fairly new wildlife rehabber working with small,<br> NY&#45;local wildlife, and thought <q>How hard can it be to take care of this guy&#63; I just know in my heart that I need to get him out of the situation he's in&#33;</q>…Well, it was like trial&#45;by&#45;fire learning how to<br> properly care for a fox, let me tell you what. But, I didn't give up&#33; <br><br>4 months old is far older than someone would normally purchase a fox for a companion animal, as it is much more difficult to bond with a fox once they're past 6 or 8 weeks old. However, because my <br>mindset was <q>I need to save him" and not "I want a pet fox</q>, I could've cared less about his age. <br><br>This marked the beginning of a rewarding journey of learning how to live with and care for this beautiful species. When word started to get around in the wildlife rescue community that I legally owned<br> and cared for a fox, I slowly started to get calls asking to assist with other foxes, which turned into me quickly becoming specialized in the area of foxes, fast forward several years, and voila, Arctic Fox Daily<br> Wildlife Rescue, Inc. came to be. <br><br>Toto was primarily a <q>hands&#45;off</q> fox, and didn't usually prefer physical attention. However, in his older years, he started to not mind the occasional love&#45;scratch here and there. Even so, he and I had an <br>incredible, unspoken bond. He was the catalyst to what we are today. I will miss him dearly and forever be thankful for what he taught me.

        Lulu came to me when she was only 7 weeks old. <br><br>She was purchased by well&#45;meaning people who thought that a fox would be a good fit as a pet for their family, but they learned otherwise. They lived in an apartment in a very populated city, <br>&#40;where it was also very illegal to own a fox without the proper licensing&#41; and they quickly found out that a fox kit is <i>not</i> like a puppy.<br><br> Long story short, they discovered that they had made a huge mistake. Knowing that Lulu was bound to eventually be confiscated, and desiring the best for her, they reached out to a canine rescue<br> and asked them to take her. The resuce called me, and the rest is history&#33; I’ve had a few foxes in my possession with almost identical backgrounds as Lulu’s. Her story is not unique, and an unfortunate<br> reality for many exotic pets. Many exotic species do not make good additions to the average home, require advanced experience, outdoor housing, and need special enrichment. It's important to realize<br> that just because they're cute and seemingly innocent &#40;especially as babies&#41;, it doesn't mean they're easy to care for. Rehoming is more difficult on exotics &#45; especially foxes &#45; than on most domestic animals. <br>Their sense of trust is very fragile, and they bond strongly and quickly to their caretakers when they're young. This is why it's crucial to do extensive research and get hands&#45;on experience with the species <br>before adding any exotic pet to your family. Thankfully, Lulu was young enough when she arrived here that it wasn't extremely difficult to establish a good relationship with her. She's my girl&#33; And like <br>a lot of us girls, she can be a little moody&#58; Some days, she flops over at my feet &#45; patiently awaiting belly rubs &#45; the second I walk into her enclosure. Other days, I can't get anywhere near her. It's always on<br> her terms.
